-> vectors are a part of STL.
-> they are dynamic arrays.
->basic syntax of vector is:

vector <int> v;   //it is a vector of integers and is named as v
vector <int> v(10);  //vector of int with size of 10 and all elements initialised as 0
vector <char> v(10,'h');  //vector of string with 10 elements and all of them are 'h'

=> some important functions of vectors:
-> v.push_back(x)  //this helps to insert value of x to end of vector in O(1) time complexity
-> v.pop_back()    //this erases the last element in O(1) time complexity
-> v.clear()   //this erase all elements in O(n) time complexity
-> v.size()   //returns size of vector in O(1)
-> cout << v[0];   //this will print element at zeroth index in a vector
