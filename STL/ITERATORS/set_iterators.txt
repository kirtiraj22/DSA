SET ITERATORS:
-they offer less features than vector iterators.
-syntax for set iterators is:

auto it = s.begin();      //here it is iterator to the first element

it++,it--,++it,--it are valid operations and they work in O(logN) time

NOTE: (it + 5) or it+=2 ,etc are invalid.
NOTE: s.end() is the iterator to a non existent element (after the last element)


IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS for set iterators

s.find(x);  //returns iterator to element with value x. and returns s.end() if not found.works in O(logN)
s.lower_bound(x);   //returns iterator to the first element which is >= x. returns s.end() if not found.works in O(logN)
s.upper_bound(x);   //returns iterator to the first element which is > x. returns s.end() if not found.works in O(logN)
s.erase(x);    //erases the element with operator it. O(logN)


note:
if(s.find(10) == s.end()) cout << "not found";
if(s.count(10) == 0) cout << "not found";

both of them are same.as s.end() is the iterator to a NON-EXISTENT element(after the last element).

NOTE :
-to remove smallest element from set use:
s.erase(s.begin());
