=> PAIRS:
->Pair is a way of creating a composite datatype composed of 2 different primitive/composite datatypes.
-> to include pairs we need to include a header file called as <utility> 
syntaxs:

pair <int,int> p;  //pair p of 2 integers
pair <int,string> p;  //pair p of an int and a string
pair <int,pair<int,string>> p;   //a pair of int and (pair of int and string)
pair <vector <int>,string> p;   // a pair of a (vector of int) and a string 



-> ACCESSING ELEMENTS:
-elements in a pair can be accessed by using .first and .second
-for eg:
pair <string,int> p = {"Hello",6};
cout << p.first << " " << p.second;       //this will pring hello 6


-> USES OF PAIR
-a function can return only a single value but using a pair we can return multiple values
 from a single function.
