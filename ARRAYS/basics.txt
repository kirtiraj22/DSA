An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. 
It is the simplest data structure where each data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.

for eg:

int arr[10];
//this is an array that can store 10 elements

cout << arr[5];
//this will output the 6th index of array because array index starts with 0

int arr[4] = {1,2,3,4};
//this is initialised with some values

int arr[10] = {0}
//this will initialise all values of array as 0

BUT 
int arr[10] = {1}
//this will not initialise all elements to 1 as it is only valid for 0
