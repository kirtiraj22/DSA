BINARY SEARCH:

-Binary search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search 
 interval in half.
-It works only if elements are in monotonous order(increasing order or decreasing order)

EG:         3 5 9 13 27
indexing :  0 1 2 3  4
target:13

so we need to find 13 in this array

STEPS:
1)find the mid element of array (in this case it is 9)
2)compare it with the target ( here target = 13 so target != 9)
3)now check if middle number is smaller or greater than the target (here 9 is smaller than the target)
4)remove all elements from left if the element is smaller than target 
OR remove all elements from right if the element is greater  than target
5)again repeat from step 1.

so given example :
target = 13

NOTE MIDDLE ELEMENT = (starting index + ending index) / 2

array   3 5 9 13 27 
index   0 1 2 3  4
here target = 13 and middle element = 9 so remove all elements from left
         
         |
         V
array   13 27
index   3  4
here target = 13 middle element = 13 so target found at index 3
          |
          V
array   13

so return index(i.e 3)

so target found
